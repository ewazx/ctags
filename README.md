Universal Ctags generates an index (or tag) file of language objects found in source files for many popular programming languages. This index makes it easy for text editors and other tools to locate the indexed items. Universal Ctags improves on traditional ctags because of its multilanguage support, its ability for the user to define new languages searched by regular expressions, and its ability to generate emacs-style TAGS files.

universal-ctags has the objective of continuing the development from
what existed in the Sourceforge area. Github exuberant-ctags
repository was started by Reza Jelveh and was later moved to the
universal-ctags organization.

The goal of the project is preparing and maintaining common/unified working
space where people interested in making ctags better can work
together.

## Differences from exuberant-ctags ##

You may be interested in how universal-ctags is different from
exuberant-ctags. See [Introduced changes](https://docs.ctags.io/en/latest/news.html)
on https://docs.ctags.io/ for details.

The most significant incompatible changes:

* Universal-ctags doesn't load
`~/.ctags` and `./.ctags` at starting up time. Instead, it loads
`~/.ctags.d/*.ctags` and `./.ctags.d/*.ctags`. See the above web
site and man pages
(man/ctags.1.rst.in and man/ctags-incompatibilities.7.in in the
source tree).

* Universal-ctags is more strict about characters that can be
  used in kind letters and kind names than Exuberant-ctags.

  - The letter must be an alphabetical character (`[a-zA-EG-Z]`).
    `F` is reserved for `file` kind.

  - The first character of the name must be alphabetic, and
    the rest characters must be alphanumeric (`[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*`).

  See the web site and man pages. The detailed background is explained
  in [#1737](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags/pull/1737).

  If you want to reuse your .ctags written for Exuberant-ctags,
  you must review kind letters and names defined with `--regex-<LANG>=...`
  options. When updating the definitions, using `--kind-<LANG>` option
  is appreciated.
